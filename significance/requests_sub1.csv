35983,"Write a solution in Java.

Given two strings a and b, return the length of the longest uncommon subsequence between a and b. If the longest uncommon subsequence does not exist, return -1.

An uncommon subsequence between two strings is a string that is a subsequence of one but not the other.

A subsequence of a string s is a string that can be obtained after deleting any number of characters from s.

- For example, ""abc"" is a subsequence of ""aebdc"" because you can delete the underlined characters in ""aebdc"" to get ""abc"". Other subsequences of ""aebdc"" include ""aebdc"", ""aeb"", and """" (empty string).
